# Mor-Go-Thruster

This is a two-part 3D-printable ROV thruster design, indended to print on hobbyist-grade fused-filament printers. The name, a silly pun, is a combination of my name (Morgan) and the name of the guy who made the previous version (God√∏).

# If you just want to print it, use "Mor-Go-single-print.stl".
The two pieces will come out slightly stuck together but they have less chance of peeling and warping that way and they're easy to separate from the top with a knife after the print is done. For deep water use, we recommended printing at 100% infill.

The two parts can be assembled with a nut and a bolt, 1/4"-28 x 1" long.

It has a concave bottom to provide for mounting onto the 4" OD aluminum tube that the Seeker ROV uses.
