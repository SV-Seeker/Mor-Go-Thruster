# The Mor-Go Thruster

This is a two-part, 3D-printable ROV thruster design, indended to print on hobbyist-grade, fused-filament printers. The name, a silly pun, is a combination of my name (Morgan) and the name of the guy who made the previous version (God√∏).

There are files with and without baked-in FFM supports/anchors. If you use the files "with-supports" you shouldn't have to add any supports in your slicing software. For deep water use, we recommended printing at 100% infill.

The two parts can be assembled with a nut and a bolt, 1/4"-28 x 1" long, and optionally with glue.

It has a concave base to provide for stable mounting onto the 4" OD aluminum tube that the Seeker ROV uses.
