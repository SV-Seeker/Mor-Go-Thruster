# The Mor-Go Thruster

This is a two-part, 3D-printable ROV thruster design, indended to print on hobbyist-grade, fused-filament printers. The name, a silly pun, is a combination of my name (Morgan) and the name of the guy who made the previous version (Godø).

There are files with and without baked-in FFM supports/anchors. If you use the files "with-supports" you shouldn't have to add any supports in your slicing software. For deep water use, we recommended printing at 100% infill.

The two parts can be assembled with a nut and a bolt, 1/4"-28 x 1" long, and optionally with glue.

It has a concave base to provide for stable mounting onto the 4" OD aluminum tube that the Seeker ROV uses.

There is also an experimental propeller design, intended to work with the Godø clamp hub design "printprop20". That file is currently available in the SV Seeker group on facebook. If you need clockwise and counterclockwise propellers, you can mirror the STL file to switch the rotation direction.
