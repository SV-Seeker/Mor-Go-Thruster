# Mor-Go-Thruster

This is a two-part 3D printable ROV thruster design. The versions with supports are indended to print on hobbyist-grade fused-filament printers. The name, a silly pun, is a combination of my name (Morgan) and the name of the guy whose design inspired this one (God√∏).

It can be assembled with a bolt, 1/4"-28 or 1/4"-20 x 1" long, and a nut. If you're metric, use m6 x 25mm long.

It has a concave bottom to provide for mounting onto the 4" OD aluminum tube that the Seeker ROV uses.
